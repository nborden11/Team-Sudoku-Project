# Final Group Project Sudoku Generator in Python

Sudoku Generator
Project Overview
This project is a fully functional Sudoku game developed as our final project for Programming 1. The game includes a user-friendly interface built with Pygame, allowing users to select from different difficulty levels, interact with the game board, and receive feedback on their progress. The game was a collaborative effort, showcasing the combined skills and problem-solving abilities of our team.

Project Structure
Sudoku.py: Main file that runs the game and manages the overall game loop and user interactions.
board.py: Manages the Sudoku game board, including drawing the grid, handling cell selection, and validating moves.
cell.py: Defines the Cell class, which represents each individual cell on the Sudoku board.
constants.py: Contains constants used throughout the project, such as colors, dimensions, and font settings.
sudoku_generator.py: Implements the logic for generating and validating the Sudoku puzzles.

Distribution of Responsibility
Nicholas Borden & Nick Santarsiero: Worked on the Board, Cell, and Sudoku classes, which manage the game’s core functionality and user interface.
Lawson Loryea & Josh Daniels: Developed the SudokuGenerator class, which handles the creation and validation of Sudoku puzzles.
